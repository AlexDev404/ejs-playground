# EJS Routing Framework

A simple EJS template for use in web development projects

## To run

```shell
npm run dev
```

```shell
npm run watch-css
```

A server should be opened up at [http://localhost:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080).
The port may be modified using the `PORT` variable in the `server.js` file.

## Outline of files

- `routes.js` — This file is used for routing the different views of the frontend dynamically
- `server.js` — This file is used to setup the environment and serve the responses contained in `routes.js`
- `routes.js` — Holds the dynamic route to serve the dynamic views generated by `views/root.ejs`. It does this by taking the route along with the query parameters and inputting it into `views/root.ejs` for processing
- `root.ejs`  — Holds the logic that serves routes dynamically from `views/pages` using the data inputted:
  - `route` — The route
  - `params` — The query parameters which may be accessed using `params.get(<parameter>)`
